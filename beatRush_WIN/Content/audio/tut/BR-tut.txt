Welcome!
Let's keep this simple ...
Those colorful shining objects are what we call 'points' ...
The blue ones serve as currency within the game and restore your health
You can buy stuff in the Shop with them ...
The other ones restore your abilities
The rocks you see generating ahead are obstacles ...
Avoid them to survive ...
Later in the game, more obstacles will begin to appear ...
They'll cause more damage to your ship ...
Survive throughout the music track to advance to a next level ...
Each level will be harder than the previous one ...
Have fun and thanks for downloading Beat Rush!
